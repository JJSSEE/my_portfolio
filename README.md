## [Project 1: Classifier](https://github.com/JJSSEE/my_portfolio/blob/main/notebooks/Parkinson's%20Disease.ipynb)

## Parkinson's Desease Detection

### Labels count
* Given in binary numbers with a healthy status of zero (0) and a desease status of one (1).

### Area Under the Curve

For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities.
