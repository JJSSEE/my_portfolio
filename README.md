## Parkinson's Desease Detection
Parkinsonâ€™s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system. The cause of the desease is unknown and there is no cure. A dataset containing information of healthy patients and patients with the desease is analyzed, and three different classification algorithms were used to detect the presense of the desease.
* Random Forest
* Logistic Regression
* XGBoost

### Target Variable
* Healthy status of zero (0) and a desease status of one (1).
* Data size characterized by being small and umbalanced.

### Confussion Matrix

* Train and test data was split at the ratio of 80/20.
* All three models identified the health status of all the patients correctly.

### ROC and AUC Matrics

* Data dimentionality was reduced by removing low variance features 
* The trainning data is overffited and it is expected given the small size of the dataset

## Superconductivity critical temperature prediction

Superconductivity is the ability of certain materials to conduct electric current with practically zero resistance. For a material to behave as a superconductor, extreme low temperatures are required. The goal of this project is to predict the critical temperature of a the material based on its atomic characteristics. In this model, the ElasticNet regressor was selected due to its built-in variable selection fitting procedures, given the high level of dimension in the Dataset.
